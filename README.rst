Scylla Python Driver
====================

A modern, feature-rich and highly-tunable Python client library for Scylla Open Source (2.1+) and Apache Cassandra (2.1+) and
Scylla Enterprise (2018.1.x+) using exclusively Cassandra's binary protocol and Cassandra Query Language v3.

The driver supports Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

.. **Note:** This driver does not support big-endian systems.

Training
--------
The course `Using Scylla Drivers <https://university.scylladb.com/courses/using-scylla-drivers/lessons/coding-with-python/>`_ in `Scylla University <https://university.scylladb.com>`_  explains how to use drivers in different languages to interact with a Scylla cluster. 
The lesson, Coding with Python (link), goes over a sample application that, using the Python driver, interacts with a three-node Scylla cluster.
It connects to a Scylla cluster, displays the contents of a  table, inserts and deletes data, and shows the contents of the table after each action.
`Scylla University <https://university.scylladb.com>`_ includes other training material and online courses which will help you become a Scylla NoSQL database expert.


Object Mapper
-------------
cqlengine (originally developed by Blake Eggleston and Jon Haddad, with contributions from the
community) is now maintained as an integral part of this package. Refer to
`documentation here <http://scylladb.github.io/python-driver/object_mapper/>`_.
